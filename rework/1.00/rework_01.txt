The BOOT circuit is wiring wrong; it was pulling to ground rather
than 3V3. Remove R10; wire the 3v3 side of R10 (nearest to board edge)
to pin 3/4 (left) of the BOOT switch; and then cut the wire to ground
at the back of the board (see photo).

Alternatively; do not solder the boot/P0.6 solder jumper in; but
rather than press the boot button; shortcircuit over R10 in the few/rare
cases you need to use this pin for BOOT.

Use with P0.6 is unaffected.
