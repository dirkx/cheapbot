The USB connectors should have been sunk into the board; however the
area under the was not milled out. As a result they stand proud at a
45 degree angle.

Solution 1:
	With a solderblob suppor the front wings - to make things sturdier.
	And dab the rear ones with a good bit extra too.

	This has shown to be quite adequate.

Solution 2:
	Fasion a U shaped bit of wire to go help make above sturdier.

Solution 3:
	Desolder the plug and solder a 'normal' rather than sunk
	plug across. MicroUSB ones tend to have 4 tabs in the right
	place; and fit once you cut the pins off at the back with
	an exacto knife.
